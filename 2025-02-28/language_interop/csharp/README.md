# C#

## Considerations

I think from the research pinvoke / c# requires the libraries to be shared and not static


## Look into...

* [.net native](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/dotnet-native/) this looks to be useful for the whole cross compilation thing
* `export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/workspaces/devlog/2025-02-28/language_interop/csharp/external_libs`
